/** Rationale:
 (a) A tensor network is a set of connected tensors.
     Each tensor in a tensor network can be connected to
     other tensors in that tensor network via tensor legs.
     Each tensor leg in a given tensor is uniquely associated
     with one of its modes, one tensor leg per tensor mode. The
     numeration of tensor modes is contiguous and starts from 0.
     A tensor leg can connect a given tensor with one or more
     other tensors in the same tensor network. Thus, tensor legs
     can be binary, ternary, etc., in general (binary is common choice).
 (b) A tensor network is always closed, which requires introducing
     an explicit output tensor collecting all open legs of the original
     tensor network. If the original tensor network does not have open
     legs, the output tensor is simply a scalar which the original tensor
     network evaluates to; otherwise, a tensor network evaluates to a tensor.
 (c) Current tensor enumeration (it is just one option):
       0: Output tensor/scalar which the tensor network evaluates to;
       1..N: Input tensors/scalars constituting the original tensor network;
       N+1..M: Intermediate tensors obtained by contractions of the input tensors.
     In general, only the output tensor is required to have id = 0; any other
     tensor in the tensor network may have any unique positive id.
 (d) Building a tensor network:
     Option 1: A new tensor can be appended into a tensor network by either:
               (1) Explicitly matching the tensor modes with the modes of all
                   other tensors present or to be present in the tensor network.
                   The fully specified output tensor with all its legs has had to
                   be provided in advance in the TensorNetwork ctor. This way
                   requires the advance knowledge of the entire tensor network.
                   Once all tensors have been appended, one needs to call .finalize()
                   to complete the construction of the tensor network.
               (2) Matching the tensor modes with the modes of the current output
                   tensor of the tensor network. In this case, the unmatched modes
                   of the newly appended tensor will be appended to the current
                   output tensor of the tensor network (at the end).
     Option 2: A tensor network can be appended to another tensor network by
               matching the modes of the output tensors of both tensor networks.
               The unmatched modes of the output tensor of the appended tensor
               network will be appended to the output tensor of the primary
               tensor network (at the end). The appended tensor network will
               cease to exist after being absorbed by the primary tensor network.
 (e) The modes of the output tensor of a tensor network can be examined and reordered.
 (f) Any tensor except the output tensor can be deleted from the tensor network.
 (g) Any two tensors, excluding the output tensor, can be merged by tensor contraction.
